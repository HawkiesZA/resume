        In my time there I worked on almost every part of the technical stack, from the web front- and backend, to the firmware for the custom hardware. I built tools for use within the company, helped with IT support where needed, and built tools for use in the factory, and systems to help improve logistics. I also led building the first version of the Android app which formed the base of the app that is in use today.
