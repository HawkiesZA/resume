        description: `As the Senior Developer at Aviro I report directly to the CTO, and manage a small team of developers. I am involved in the entire tech stack, from database queries, to building out our backend in Python, to developing our main application (Pocket Clinic) in Kotlin for Android-based tablets.
        Our backend is deployed to AWS Lambda functions and consumed by the application.
        The Android app is quite involved, as it has to be fully functional offline as many of our clients work in environments with patchy or no internet connectivity.`

        Most of my time was spent on the Android app which is in Kotlin, while still maintaining a foot in the backend particularly in creating specific backend infrastructure for the app. Technologies used include: NodeJS, TypeScript, Git, Gitlab, Grafana, Docker, k8s, and Kotlin.

        description: `At Global Kinetic the teams were organised according to the client that they were working for. I joined a small team of 4, where I was the Android developer on the team, alongside a backend developer, iOS developer, and a QA. Together we developed a banking application for a new commercial bank in South Africa.

        I was leading the Android development, and this involved sizing and shaping the work that needed to be done, doing UI and integration work, and working with the QA to iron out any problems.
        
        Technologies used included: Java, RxJava, Android, git, gerrit. We followed the SCRUM process with sprints and sprint planning every 2 weeks.

        description: `I was part of a small team developing a point of sale platform for cash-based microtransactions in informal markets. 

        This involved a custom point of sale terminal which we manufactured and developed firmware for, as well as a cloud-based backend to manage devices in the field, stock distribution, reporting, and providing clients with a rich set of APIs and a frontend to help clients manage their business easily.
        
        The team used Kanban, Continuous Delivery, and TDD on all parts.
        
        In my time there I worked on almost every part of the technical stack, from the web front- and backend, to the firmware for the custom hardware. I built tools for use within the company, helped with IT support where needed, and built tools for use in the factory, and systems to help improve logistics. I also led building the first version of the Android app which formed the base of the app that is in use today.
        
        I enjoyed constantly learning, and so I enjoyed the freedom to move around between all of the different parts of the company.
